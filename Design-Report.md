# Design Report

Open-Close principle (OCP): "Your software should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
Let's say your client asks you to extend the big-2 game with new card patterns. Can you support his requirement
in such a way that "you only need to write new classes,
without any modifications to the previously existing classes (except Main, we typically call the Main class 'the Client')"?
Provide a design report (Design-Report.md) proving how do you achieve this.
          

> You don't need to elaborate on your whole design, just **straight to the point**
> on how do you practice OCP. You are encouraged to show me your class diagram.

> You will either get 0 or 15 points on this bonus. 
> If you can't achieve it, don't report anything here.
